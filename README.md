Final Web Development Project Completed!

I’ve successfully built a complete and responsive e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

✅ Dynamic product display
✅ Add to cart functionality
✅ Mobile responsive layout
✅ Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile)
✅ Optimized performance with lazy loading, minimized code, and fewer HTTP requests

🛠️ This project helped me apply all the skills I’ve learned and improve my understanding of frontend development.
